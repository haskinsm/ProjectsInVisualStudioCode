# ProjectsInVisualStudioCode
Includes Haskell, HTML &amp; CSS, Python projects. Will be for various projects particularly web dev orientated ones.
Contains work:
- from 3rd year module Introduction to Functional programming (Haskell). Received a mark of 74% in this module.
- from 3rd year module Software Applications 3&4. In this module I have created two websites. The first was a basic website for a society ('SappsPHP') and the second was a website for a 
a party rental equipment company ('group10PHPMySQL'). For the second website I was working in a group of 3. For both of these websites I designed a database in MySQL. I inserted data to the database from forms I created on the website. I also queried data to populate report tables, check availability of products, and to use in calculations (like VAT rate, delivery Rate, etc).
