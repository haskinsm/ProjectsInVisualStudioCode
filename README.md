# ProjectsInVisualStudioCode
Includes projects which are partly or fully written in Haskell, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, PHP and Python. 

Contains work:
- from 3rd year module Introduction to Functional programming (Haskell). Received a mark of 74% in this module.
- from 3rd year module Software Applications 3&4. In this module I have created two websites. The first was a basic website for a society ('SappsPHP') and the second was a website for a party rental equipment company ('group10PHPMySQL'). For the second website I was working in a group of 3. For both of these websites I designed a database in MySQL. I inserted data to the database from forms I created on the website. I also queried data to populate report tables, check availability of products, and to use in calculations (like VAT rate, delivery Rate, etc). Unfortunately a Trinity VPN is required to view the websites so I cannot add a link to them here.
