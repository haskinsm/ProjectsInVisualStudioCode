                    JavaScript (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions, and is best known <br>
                    as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well. It is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm <br>
                    scripting language that is dynamic, and supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles. <br>
                </p>
                <p> 
                    JavaScript runs on the client side of the web, which can be used to design / program how the web pages behave on the occurrence of <br>
                    an event. JavaScript is an easy to learn and also powerful scripting language, widely used for controlling web page behavior. <br>

                    Contrary to popular misconception, JavaScript is not "Interpreted Java". In a nutshell, JavaScript is a dynamic scripting language <br>
                    supporting prototype based object construction. The basic syntax is intentionally similar to both Java and C++ to reduce the number of new <br>
                    concepts required to learn the language. Language constructs, such as if statements, for and while loops, and switch and try ... catch <br>
                    blocks function the same as in these languages (or nearly so).
